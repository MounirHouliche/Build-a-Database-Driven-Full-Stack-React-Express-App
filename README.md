# Build-a-Database-Driven-Full-Stack-React-Express-App

ðŸŽ¯ What requirements did you achieve?

I successfully met all the main requirements of the task.
I created a React client that allows users to view and add posts.
Built an Express server with both GET and POST endpoints.
Connected the backend to a Supabase database to store and retrieve posts.
Designed and seeded a basic database schema.
Used React Router to create multiple pages (Home, Posts, and New Post).
Implemented React forms for submitting new posts.
Displayed posts using .map() and used useEffect() with an interval to poll the database for updates.
Deployed the client and server successfully.

ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

All of the main functionality was achieved. However, I wasnâ€™t able to add advanced features such as user authentication, detailed error handling, or a more styled user interface due to time constraints.

ðŸŽ¯ If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

The most challenging part was connecting and configuring Supabase with the Express server, especially when dealing with environment variables and deployment issues on Render. Ensuring that the frontend and backend communicated correctly using the right URLs also required careful debugging. Once those issues were resolved, the rest of the app worked smoothly.
